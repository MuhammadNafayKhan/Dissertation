Aim
The purpose of this project is to compare four different machine learning models namely GBR, SVR, LSTM, and TCN for the prediction of cryptocurrency prices using the historical and real-time data from bitfinex.

Objectives
Collect and preprocess comprehensive cryptocurrency data-including real-time prices, historical OHLC, trading volume, and on-chain metrics-from bitfinex/coin gecko to ensure data quality and relevance for model training.
Develop and train four predictive models; GBR, SVR, LSTM, and TCN using the curated dataset.
Evaluate and compare the performance of these models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, computational efficiency, focusing on their accuracy, robustness to market volatility, and suitability for real-time forecasting.
Develop a user-friendly interface that visualizes and displays the cryptocurrency price forecasts generated by each model.
 
 Implementation Overview
 - Data sources: Yahoo Finance (yfinance) primary; Bitfinex public candles; optional Refinitiv (with credentials) for institutional-grade OHLCV.
 - Training: Google Colab GPU via `notebooks/crypto_forecasting_colab.ipynb`.
 - Models: GBR, SVR (sklearn), LSTM and TCN (Keras). Walk-forward evaluation.
 - Artifacts: Saved under `artifacts/` with a model registry JSON for the Streamlit app.
 - App: Streamlit dashboard for model selection, symbol selection, horizon, and forecast visualization.
 
 Quickstart
 1. Open `notebooks/crypto_forecasting_colab.ipynb` in Google Colab (enable GPU) and run all cells to train and export artifacts.
 2. Copy the generated `artifacts/` folder into the repo root.
 3. Run the Streamlit app locally: `streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py`.
 
 Notes
 - To enable Refinitiv, install `refinitiv-data` and set `RD_APP_KEY` in the environment.
 - Default data interval is daily; intraday via yfinance is supported by changing the interval in the notebook.
 
 Task Plan
 1. Implement data adapters (Yahoo, Refinitiv) and feature engineering.
 2. Build windowing and walk-forward evaluation.
 3. Train GBR, SVR, LSTM, TCN in Colab and save artifacts.
 4. Wire up Streamlit UI with model selection and live charting.
 5. Validate end-to-end and document results.
